<p> My business background come from technology hardware fields (both industrial and consumer product).  Recent five years, I focus on overall operation management those includes product development and review, market analysis, direct product launching roadmaps and eCommerce implementation, oversee distributing channels, review marketing material and financial report, and oversee supply chains and logistics management.  The distribution channels such as The Home Depot/Amazon Vendor/FBA (USA/Canada/EU), Walmart and Ace Hardware are one of my expertise.</p>


<br><br>
<p> A career accomplishment to me means place each milestones successfully and learned from experiences.  I like to challenge myself, deliver solutions, and explore to new products and fields in addition to day-to-day operation management.  </p>
